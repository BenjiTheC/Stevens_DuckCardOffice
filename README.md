# DuckCard: newly admitted students' ID card printing data process tool

The DuckCard is made for the related data process of importing the students' info from Slate to Blackboard and printing the cards from JSA.

The reason for building this CLI app is that, the automated sync process between systems used by Stevens will not be turned on until the start of every semester. In order to print the Stevens ID card for the newly admitted incoming students in advance, we will need to validate and import the data extracted from Slate to Blackboard. And to do that, I choos Python over Excel, because **Benji is a nerd**.

This program will be shared and maintained among the memebers of DuckCard office, I happy if anyone can help add more functionality and make this app more stable.

## Current status Feb 24th, 2019

I'm thinking about migrating the program to MongoDB on Benbuntu, don't know if it's applicable or not, but gonna try it out.
